## About
EmbedBot is a Discord bot which can create and send embeds in text channels.

## Installing and configuring EmbedBot 
EmbedBot runs in a Docker container, and there is a [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file which simplifies this process.

### Clone the repository
To start off, clone the repository into your desired directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrackeysBot/EmbedBot.git
```
Step into the EmbedBot directory using `cd EmbedBot`, and continue with the steps below.

### Setting things up
The bot's token is passed to the container using the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable. Create a file named `.env`, and add the following line:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Two directories are required to exist for Docker compose to mount as container volumes, `data` and `logs`:
```bash
mkdir data
mkdir logs
```
Copy the example `config.example.json` to `data/config.json`, and assign the necessary config keys. Below is breakdown of the config.json layout:
```json
{
  "GUILD_ID": {
    "logChannel": /* The ID of the log channel */,
    "primaryColor": /* The primary branding colour, as a 24-bit RGB integer. Defaults to #7837FF */,
    "secondaryColor": /* The secondary branding colour, as a 24-bit RGB integer. Defaults to #E33C6C */,
    "tertiaryColor": /* The tertiary branding colour, as a 24-bit RGB integer. Defaults to #FFE056 */,
    "urgentReportThreshold": /* How many message reports until the bot uses @ everyone instead of @ here. Defaults to 5  */,
    "mute": {
      "gagDuration": /* The duration of a gag, in milliseconds. Defaults to 5 minutes */,
      "maxModeratorMuteDuration": /* The maximum duration that a Moderator is allowed to mute, in milliseconds. Defaults to 14 days */
    },
    "reactions": {
      "deleteMessageReaction": /* The fallback reaction to delete messages, in Discord format. Defautls to üóëÔ∏è (:wastebasket:) */,
      "gagReaction": /* The fallback reaction to gag users, in Discord format. Defautls to üîá (:mute:) */,
      "historyReaction": /* The fallback reaction to view infraction history, in Discord format. Defautls to üïì (:clock4:) */,
      "reportReaction": /* The fallback reaction to report messages, in Discord format. Defautls to üö© (:triangular_flag_on_post:) */
    },
    "roles": {
      "administratorRoleId": /* The ID of the Admin role */,
      "guruRoleId": /* The ID of the Guru role */,
      "moderatorRoleId": /* The ID of the Mod role */,
      "mutedRoleId": /* The ID of the muted role */
    }
  }
}
```
The `logs` directory is used to store logs in a format similar to that of a Minecraft server. `latest.log` will contain the log for the current day and current execution. All past logs are archived.

The `data` directory is used to store persistent state of the bot, such as config values and the infraction database.

### Launch EmbedBot
To launch EmbedBot, simply run the following commands:
```bash
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up --detach
```

## Updating EmbedBot
To update EmbedBot, simply pull the latest changes from the repo and restart the container:
```bash
git pull
sudo docker-compose stop
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up --detach
```
